        <section name="Introduction">

            <p>The <strong>Jar Scan Filter</strong> element represents the component that
                filters results from the <a href="jar-scanner.html">Jar Scanner</a> before
                they are passed back to the application. It is typically used to skip the
                scanning of JARs that are known not to be relevant to some or all types of
                scan.
            </p>

            <p>A Jar Scan Filter element MAY be nested inside a
                <a href="jar-scanner.html">Jar Scanner</a>
                component.
            </p>

            <p>For example you can specify additional jar files when scanning for pluggable
                features:
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[<Context>
  ...
  <JarScanner>
    <JarScanFilter
        pluggabilityScan="${tomcat.util.scan.StandardJarScanFilter.jarsToScan},
                       my_pluggable_feature.jar"/>
  </JarScanner>
  ...
</Context>]]></source>

            <p>If a Jar Scan Filter element is not included, a default Jar Scan Filter
                configuration will be created automatically, which is sufficient for most
                requirements.

                            implement the <code>org.apache.tomcat.JarScanFilter</code> interface.
                            If not specified, the standard value (defined below) will be used.

            <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

                <p>The standard implementation of <strong>Jar Scan Filter</strong> is
                    <strong>org.apache.tomcat.util.scan.StandardJarScanFilter</strong>.
                    Additional attributes that it supports (in addition to the common attributes
                    listed above) are listed in the table.
                </p>

                <p>The values for <strong>pluggabilitySkip</strong>,
                    <strong>pluggabilityScan</strong>, <strong>tldSkip</strong>,
                    <strong>tldScan</strong>
                    attributes are lists of file name pattern. The
                    patterns are separated by comma (','). The leading and trailing whitespace
                    characters in a pattern are ignored. The patterns are matched
                    case-sensitively. The following two special characters are supported:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>'*' - means zero or more characters,</li>
                    <li>'?' - means one and only one character.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Note that excluding a JAR from the pluggability scan will prevent a
                    ServletContainerInitializer from being loaded from a web application JAR
                    (i.e. one located in <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>) but it will not prevent
                    a ServletContainerInitializer from being loaded from the container (Tomcat).
                    To prevent a ServletContainerInitializer provided by container from being
                    loaded, use the <code>containerSciFilter</code> property of the
                    <a href="context.html">Context</a>.
                </p>
