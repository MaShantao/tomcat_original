# NetBeans will automatically set the project basedir "." correctly to
# the parent directory of the nbproject subdirectory
#
# The Tomcat build.properties file defines the confusingly-named "base.path"
# property, which is where the Tomcat dependencies are downloaded.
# If you have followed the Tomcat recommendation and explicitly coded
# a path, it will be used by NetBeans. However, if you have left it to
# default you MUST explicitly code it here, e.g.
#base.path=/home/yourname/sandboxApache/tomcat8-dependencies
# NetBeans syntax checking and code completion of the main source files
# needs all the Ant libraries to be on the classpath. This is achieved
# by the standard build.xml, but needs to be duplicated for NetBeans.
