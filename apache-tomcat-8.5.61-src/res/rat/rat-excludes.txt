  This is excludes file for Apache RAT tool run by ASF Buildbot,
  https://creadur.apache.org/rat/

  The following files are excluded:

  - log files and other temporary files generated during testing

  - *.html files in documentation are generated from XML sources

  - *.sha512 files are generated and cannot contain license

  - *.manifest, MANIFEST.MF JAR manifest files cannot contain license

  - package-list and script.js files in API documentation (javadoc) are
    generated

  - other test files, such as trivial textual files containing only "OK' string,
    files in unusual encodings or compressed files are also excluded.

  - JSON files (RFC7159) are data and cannot contain comments

  - local build configuration files

  - file fragments that are combined during the build process and therefore can
    not contain a license header in every fragment

  - JavaEE XML schemas that are CDDL licensed

  - Checkstyle configuration file that defines how to check for the presence of
    ALv2 headers

  - files used simply to ensure directories are not empty

  - *.bmp, *.dia files are binary
    (*.gif, *.jpg are also binary, but are automatically detected by RAT as
    ones, so no explicit configuration is needed)

  - Markdown files for display in their GitHub UI

  - Temporary cache files used by Checkstle

  - Configuration files for third party Continuous Integration systems like Travis CI
